    "In Python, the !r within an f-string is a conversion flag that specifies how an expression inside the f-string should be formatted. Specifically, !r calls the repr() function on the object, which returns a \"developer-friendly\" or \"official\" string representation of that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "When you use !r after an expression within the curly braces {} of an f-string, Python will evaluate the expression and then apply repr() to its result before embedding it into the final string."

    "Exception handling in Python is a mechanism for gracefully dealing with runtime errors, known as exceptions, that disrupt the normal flow of a program. It prevents program crashes and allows for more robust and reliable code.\n",
